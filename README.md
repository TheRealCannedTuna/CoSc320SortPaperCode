# CoSc320SortPaperCode

This repository contains the source code used for the sorting algorithms in Jason Press' CoSc 320 Sort Paper for CoSc 320: Data Structures. All code used is part of the "exercise for the student" located in [dp4dsDistribution.zip](https://cslab.pepperdine.edu/warford/cosc320/dp4dsDistribution.zip), part of the 2019 prepublication version of *Design Patterns for Data Structures* by Dung X.
