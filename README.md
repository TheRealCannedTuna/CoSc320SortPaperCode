# CoSc 320 Sort Paper Code

This repository contains the source code used for the sorting algorithms in Jason Press' CoSc 320 Sort Paper for CoSc 320: Data Structures. All code used is part of the "exercise for the student" located in [dp4dsDistribution.zip](https://cslab.pepperdine.edu/warford/cosc320/dp4dsDistribution.zip), part of the 2019 prepublication version of *Design Patterns for Data Structures* by Dung X. Nguyen and J. Stanley Warford of Pepperdine University, allowed to be distributed under a CC BY-SA License. 

[15a19written.pdf](https://github.com/TheRealCannedTuna/CoSc320SortPaperCode/blob/main/15a19written.pdf) is the actual paper.

Thank you, Dr. Warford.
